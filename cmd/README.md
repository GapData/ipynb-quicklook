You'll need `bash` and a working `Go` environment. Then just launch the build script, `./build.sh`, and you're good to go. You may want to comment out some of the cross compilation lines.

- add link to repo at the end of the HTML, so people know where to complain (also that this is a pre-alpha thing)
